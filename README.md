# Sales-prediction-of-an-outlet

Here i am predicting the sales of a particular data which is been collected in past years.
Thing like outlet size , location etc are been used to train machine leearning model to be able to detect the sales of outlet of comapany.
This is my very first project using  pycaret library of python. this library is really amazing and gave me quite amazing results  without much coding.
earlier i tried doing this problem with conventional approach which took quite a good amount of time and lesse accuracy but this madethe work very easier and tune the model too is very  easy now. i recommend everyone to give it one shot.
